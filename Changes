0.07    2008-11-22
        * Added POD 'GETTING STARTED' section, including a
          permalink to ex/getting_started.html example.
        * Renamed ex/sample.pod.txt back to ex/sample.pod
        * Added IO::Scalar (used by test suite) to prereq list
          to avoid test suite failures.
        * Changed "you're" to "you are" in ex/getting_started.pod
          to avoid t/getting_started.t failure when system does
          different html encoding ("you're" vs "you&#39;re").

0.06    2008-11-20
        * added a 'Getting Started' example
        * added 'use 5.006' and MIN_PERL_VERSION to Makefile.PL
        * Updated examples to advent_year=2008
        * Added $Pod::Advent::BODY_ONLY package var attribute to suppress
          header & footer printing -- intended for testing purposes for
          testing small POD snippets.
        * Added a __reset() method to reset the package vars -- intended
          for testing purposes for multiple parsing (e.g. t/snippets.t).
        * Added t/snippets.t -- take advantage of $BODY_ONLY package vat.
        * renamed coverage to docs/coverage.txt

0.05    2007-12-26
        * If input is a filename, adds a 'POD' link at the bottom of the html
        * Added an accessor/mutator for css_url() to customize the stylesheet
        * new tests: attributes.t & packagevars.t
        * the '=for advent_*' tags no longer cause empty <p></p> tags
        * Tweaks to make it pass HTML validation, including
          changing the <B> & <I> tags to <span>'s w/css.
        * added coverage (text file of Devel::Cover summary) to MANIFEST
        * cleaned up TODO list

0.04    2007-12-19
        * fix to t/sample.t to completely strip the
          'Generated By' lines before conmparison.
          Otherwise any system not using the same
          versions of Pod::Simple or Perl::Tidy
          will fail the test.

0.03    2007-12-19
        * Bugfix -- $parser->output_fh() can be undef ..
          have to default $fh to STDOUT in that case.
        * Added t/sample.t -- it processes ex/sample.pod.txt
          and compares results to ex/sample.html -- coverage
          is very good from it; quality needs to be expaned in
          future and additional test files, however.
        * sync'd up ex/sample.html, and added additional examples
        * removed obsolete Y<> and =head1 NAME/AUTHOR support
        * Added full POD example in SYNOPSIS

0.02    2007-12-18
        * Changed M<> href back to ?module instead of ?query
        * Added 'Generated by' string to HTML output
        * Renamed br() to nl() for clarity
        * Output is now written to $parser->output_fh instead of STDOUT
          This allows calling code (such as tests!) to use Pod::Simple's
          output_fh() and output_string() methods.
        * Added style.css to MANIFEST
        * Renamed ex/sample.pod to ex/sample.pod.txt
        * Added pod to bin/pod2advent
        * Added ex/sample.pl to MANIFEST
        * Added t/general.t to MANIFEST as start of test suite.
        * Pod/Advent.pm POD additions

0.01    2007-12-17
        * Initial release.
